# Fct_Useful_Maybe
Set of local fcts that might be useful

# Butterworth filter
* Bandpass Butterworth filter
* Highpass Butterworth filter

# Normal DFT
* The normal discrete Fourier transform  
There are always someone (like me) who would like to use a normal discret Fourier transform instead of the FFT.
